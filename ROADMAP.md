# ROADMAP

## C

- [x] Study the Kalman filter algorithm from the MATLAB code

- [x] Implement the Kalman filter algorithm

- [x] Make the C function's input and output the current and the predicted mouse coordinates respectively, respectively
 
- [x] Produce the shared library function as `dll`

## LabWindows

- [ ] Show the previous mouse trajectory and the predicted mouse coordinate in the interface

- [ ] Mark the current and predicted coordinates with blue and red circles, respectively

- [ ] Plot the direction vector from the current to the predicted coordinate

- [ ] Show the predicted and real coordinates as the predicted and real trajectories (WHAT)

- [ ] Plot  the  least-squares  error  between  the  predicted  and  the  real coordinate points

## Report

> The project report print-out together with the codes should be zipped and sent to etuncer@metu.edu.tr before the demo session which will be announced later.

> The project report should include the theoretical background  which  should  be  in  accordance  with  the  implemented  code. 

> It  should  also  include  all  the results, plots, etc.

> The report should also be brought to the demo session.
